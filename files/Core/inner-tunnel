	#  proxied elsewhere for authentication.  If you are not
	#  careful, this means that the user can cause you to forward
	#  the authentication to another RADIUS server, and have the
	#  accounting logs *not* sent to the other server.  This makes
	#  it difficult to bill people for their network activity.

#

#  This section lists which modules are available for authentication.

#  that a module from the 'authorize' section adds a configuration
#  attribute 'Auth-Type := FOO'.  That authentication type is then
#  used to pick the apropriate module from the list below.
#

#  In general, you SHOULD NOT set the Auth-Type attribute.  The server
#  will figure it out on its own, and will do the right thing.  The
#  most common side effect of erroneously setting the Auth-Type
#  attribute is that one authentication method will work, but the
#  others will not.
#
#  The common reasons to set the Auth-Type attribute by hand
#  is to either forcibly reject the user, or forcibly accept him.

	#  The example policy below updates the outer tunnel reply
	#  (usually Access-Accept) with the User-Name from the inner
	#  tunnel User-Name.  Since this section is processed in the
	#  context of the inner tunnel, "request" here means "inner
	#  tunnel request", and "outer.reply" means "outer tunnel
	#  reply attributes".
	#
	#  This example is most useful when the outer session contains
	#  a User-Name of "anonymous@....", or a MAC address.  If it
	#  is enabled, the NAS SHOULD use the inner tunnel User-Name
	#  in subsequent accounting packets.  This makes it easier to
	#  track user sessions, as they will all be based on the real
	#  name, and not on "anonymous".
	#
	#  The problem with doing this is that it ALSO exposes the
	#  real user name to any intermediate proxies.  People use
	#  "anonymous" identifiers outside of the tunnel for a very
	#  good reason: it gives them more privacy.  Setting the reply
	#  to contain the real user name removes ALL privacy from
	#  their session.
	#
	#  If you want privacy to remain, see the
	#  Chargeable-User-Identity attribute from RFC 4372.  In order
	#  to use that attribute, you will have to allocate a
	#  per-session identifier for the user, and store it in a
	#  long-term database (e.g. SQL).  You should also use that
	#  attribute INSTEAD of the configuration below.
